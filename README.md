# Finora - Empowering you to spend less

Finora is an iOS only app that attempts to empower users to spend less daily.

# Why Finora? (The Problem)

Financial stress is a growing epidemic in the US and other parts of the world. Financial stress can lead to: Poor physical health, migraines, heart disease, diabetes, sleep problems, and more. With the increasing lack of personal finance management know-how, most individuals turn to micro-savings apps that only save a tiny fraction when they spend and other apps that moves money around to create an illusion of saving. These solutions aren't sustainable and does nothing for the individual struggling with financial stress. To minimize financial stress and ensure the financial health of individuals at scale, we believe that individuals must develop better spending habits. With Finora, we have created an application that associates positive emotions with the art of spending less to promote better personal finance management.



# Traget Customer Segments

1. College Students: Despite the fact that most students don't have extensive discretionary income. They are known to be impulsive spenders and cultivate bad spending habits during their active schooling years. Also, has they mature into adults, we believe the importance of personal finance management is cricial to ensure their financial health in the long term.

2. Working Professionals & Gig Workers : With the height of consumerism today, the need for personal financial visibility is apparent. From $5 cappuccino to $100 lunch meals, we think working professionals should be informed about the impact of their daily financial decisions - not matter how small. Most individuals can't fully comprehend the ripple effects of their day-to-day financial actions.



# Feature Prioritization (MVP)

Upon the conception of Finora, the approach to develop a simple application to solve the above outlined problem wasn't clear. Ultimately, I decied to focus on the below features as part of the MVP.

1. Daily spend limits
2. Reinenforce positive emotions daily with emojis (Based on spending)
3. Gamification across user specific cohorts (Based on daily transaction volume)
4. Weekly spending snapshot

These 3 features addresses major parts of the problem associated with impromptu spending on a daily basis and will help to create the necessary mentality and shape the behaviors required to sustain the financial health of the average user.


# Measuring success

In line with all digital products, it is crutial to measure success and adjust accordingly - if required, and improve as users behaviors changes and the competitive landscape evolves. With Finora, measuring success is a little bit tricky because the product is designed to interupt the user as little as possible via push notifications and messages. As a result, user clicks, swipes and general user interactions with the app are limited by design. However, we utilized the following metrics to measure success at every point in the user journey.

1. No. of downloads via channel (i.e. direct, social, referral and others) - Product Virality
2. Email CTRs/Open rates (i.e. Push Noticiations, Spending summary email, text messages) - Product Engagement
3. Daily usuage & Monthly usuage (Open rates) - Product Stickness
4. Reduction (in %) of amount spent per week - Delivering on Product Promise
